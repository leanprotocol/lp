    "whatIs": "Rybelsus is a unique medication manufactured by Novo Nordisk because it's the only oral (by mouth) tablet form among these weight loss and diabetes medications. It contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient as Wegovy and Ozempic, but you take it as a tablet by mouth instead of injecting it. For Indians who are needle-phobic or prefer not to give themselves injections, Rybelsus offers a modern, convenient alternative. It's primarily approved for Type 2 diabetes but is increasingly used for weight management as well.",

    "subtitle": "Rybelsus eliminates the barrier of needle anxiety that prevents some people from using injection medications, making treatment more accessible. For Indians managing multiple health conditions or medications, adding a simple tablet to take twice daily alongside meals can be more convenient than learning injection techniques. The medication is equally effective as the injectable forms of semaglutide (Wegovy and Ozempic) when used properly. It helps control blood sugar levels effectively while reducing appetite, making it suitable for those with diabetes concerns alongside weight management.",

    "introText": "Rybelsus has a specific administration protocol that differs from other oral diabetes medications. You must take it on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything, to ensure proper absorption. The tablet starts dissolving in your mouth as you place it on your tongue, but it's important not to swallow it whole. Your doctor will start you at a lower dose and increase gradually based on your response. Adherence to the specific timing and method of taking Rybelsus is critical for its effectiveness.",
